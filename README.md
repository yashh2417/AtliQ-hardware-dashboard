# AtliQ Hardware Tableau Dashboard

This cutting-edge dashboard leverages the power of SQL, SQL databases, and Tableau to provide comprehensive and actionable insights into the hardware sales performance. 

## Key features of the AtliQ Hardware Sales Insights Dashboard include:

Real-time sales data visualization: Gain instant access to up-to-date sales metrics and trends.
In-depth sales performance analysis: Identify top-performing products, sales channels, and customer segments.
Interactive exploration: Drill down into specific data points to uncover hidden patterns and opportunities.
Customized reporting: Generate tailored reports for different departments and stakeholders.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
AtliQ Hardware is a company facing declining sales across its various regions in India. The sales director, Bhavin Patel, struggles to accurately assess the situation due to unreliable information from regional managers. These managers often provide overly optimistic reports and overwhelming amounts of data in Excel format, making it difficult for Bhavin to gain clear insights.
To address this issue, Bhavin needs a tool that can provide a visual representation of the company's sales performance. By using a data visualization tool like Tableau, Bhavin can easily identify top-performing customers, underperforming regions, and overall revenue trends. This data-driven approach will replace the unreliable information from regional managers with accurate, actionable insights.
Essentially, the problem is a lack of reliable data and the inability to effectively analyze existing data, leading to poor decision-making. The solution is to implement a data visualization tool to provide clear and actionable insights.

The sales directors and managers discusses feedback on a dashboard and potential improvements.

### Key points:
Contextual filter issue: The dashboard wasn't correctly filtering data when looking at specific regions (like Delhi). This was resolved by using a contextual filter.
Declining sales: Sales have decreased compared to previous years. Possible reasons include product quality, promotion, team performance, and external factors.
Dashboard improvements: The dashboard can be enhanced by adding more tables for deeper analysis and including profit and margin information.
Actionable insights: The dashboard can help identify underperforming regions and employees, enabling targeted actions like performance reviews, incentives, or customer relationship building.

### Overall goal:
To improve the dashboard's functionality and provide actionable insights to increase sales and profit.
